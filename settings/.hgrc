[trusted]
### For security reasons, Mercurial will not use the settings in the .hg/hgrc file from a 
#   repository if it doesn't belong to a trusted user or to a trusted group. The main 
#   exception is the web interface, which automatically uses some safe settings, since 
#   it's common to serve repositories from different users. 

### This section specifies what users and groups are trusted.  The
#   current user is always trusted.  To trust everybody, list a user
#   or a group with name "*".

#users = *
#groups = *
